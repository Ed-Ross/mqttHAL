How does it work ?

You call
python xPL-PyHal.py start 
(or stop, console, restart)

*********** xPL-PyHal.py ***********
Creates a xPLattach (from BrainPyHal) object
Creates a xPLmessage (from xPLmessage) object
Creates a demon (from Daemon) and starts the listener in the XPLattach object
	*********** BrainPyHAL ***********
	Reads the local cortex file, or the distant cortex file (in Google Drive), with all instructions [n'a rien Ã  faire dans le Brain !!] - (based on function in cortexManager)
	Creates inbibitors and enablers
	Starts Listening
	Reads instructions from incoming message
	Launches actions based on instructions (class actionsThreading)
		*********** actionsThreading ***********
		Starts a thread for each action to be performed
	

/!\ downloadCortex deprecated ? Or just for manual operation ?
